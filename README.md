A place for musicians to gather in the spirit of song and dance. Dunno, thought we could try something out in this direction. 

This is the only file in the repository...along with a requirements.txt that can be installed with virtualenv. I think the python version is 3.7.1 using homebrew. The repository is private, but there's a free student version accessible from this link:

What do you say to some fun time coding?
