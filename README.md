# Entertainment place
A place for ppl to share in the spirit of entertainment.  Dunno, thought we could try something out in this direction. 

Nothing as of yet...
This is the only file in the repository...along with a requirements.txt that can be installed with virtualenv. I think the python version is 3.7.1 using homebrew. github is free if the repos are public so this repo is public atm, but there's a free student version accessible from this link:

(might want to pick a long date if u register. they use that as the trial period. :) mine is valid for two years )

What do you say to some fun time coding?

I'm thinking we could use a framework called flask. really lightweight and quick to do some fun stuff. (this framework started off as a joke, so I think we're in good hands haha  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flask_(web_framework) )
